 ## Spring Cloud Contract Basic
 ### Changes in producer application
 - Create a folder named ```contracts``` if not present in src/test/resource directory
 - Create a ReturnAllReservations.groov file, we can have thousands of  fies/schema for each test cases
 - Add cloud contract plugin in ```pom.xml``` and specify your ```BaseClass```
 - Create a ```BaseClass``` file andd write the required code.
 - Now build the application once build is completed, we can view the autogenerated test using below command.
```
find . -iname ContractVerifierTest.java
cat <file name>
```
 ## changes in consumer application
- Make the following changes in ```ConsumerApplicationTest.java``` file.
  ```
  @AutoConfigureStubRunner(stubsMode = StubsMode.LOCAL,
  ids = "com.producer:producer:+:8080")   -> it says go to local repository, search for com.producer group id, wih artificat id producer
  with latest version and run it on port 8080.
  ```
- Now run the application, if you observe test will fail as ```reservationName``` field is null, so change reservationName to name.
- Again run the test this time test shouuld be pass.
